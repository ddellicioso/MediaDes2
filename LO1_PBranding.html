                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p> For this learning outcome we made a <a href="" target="_blank">Figma prototype</a>  to implement our ideas for the client's website.
                        Before making this website, we specifically <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lp-RUeVnZsLbFPG_pYhnN_c6ZGQocOTVHpMw_GXedxM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">interviewed </a> our clients(Marianne and Cees) and made <a href="./pdf/Orchestra Members Survey.docx" target="_blank">surveys</a>  for our target audience (*more details in Learning Outcome *)
                    </p>

                    <div class="did">
                        <h3>What I Did</h3>

                        <div class="did_content">
                            <p> After we made sure about what our clients and target audience wants, I was assigned to make several pages such as, Agenda page, About Us page, New Talents page, and Percussion page.
                                First of all I skimmed through the GMC's old website to see where the problem is, which part need fixings, while also discussing with my teammates. <br><br>
                                I also made sure to use the <span class="highlight">same colors</span>  and <span class="highlight">match the theme</span> like our <a href="./pdf/brandguide_revised.pdf" target="_blank">brand guide</a>  as well as my teammates' designs. <br><br>
                                The part that I really liked was about "New Talent" page. I thought that this page has a potential (the left side is the original GMC web and right side is my idea), <br>
                                 so I put more things in it for example the <span class="highlight">group lessons details</span>  (which I think they didn't advertise them much and they should do) along with some informations, a photo gallery about people who joined them, and a simple FAQ.
                            </p>

                    <h4>Feedback</h4>
                        <div class="feedback_section">
                            <div class="feedback">
                                <p>
                                    We didn't have time to do user testing nor ask for some feedback from anyone before the presentation. On the day of the final presentation, our clients said:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Agenda Page looks old fashioned</li>
                                        <li>They like the fonts we used</li>
                                        <li>They like the program details in the New Talents Page</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unfortunately since the feedback are given on the last presentation, I couldn't change anything about it. The reason why I made it like that is that because we think that our client will be <span class="highlight">easier to update</span>  or change it because they already know how to use it.
                                    But nonetheless, I do agree with their comments.
                                </p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">How did it went</span>: From my view, I did everything I could do and was assigned to. Though I feel unfortunate about the Agenda page. <br><br> 
                        <span class="how">What did I learn</span>: I couldn't get any feedback because I didn't manage my time properly and I <span class="highlight">ran out of time</span> . So I realized that managing my time and schedule is important especially with the short amount of time given to do this project. <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What will change</span>: I want to make sure that I do my best to have<span class="highlight"> enough time</span>  to ask for a feedback before making a product, I also should do <span class="highlight"> deeper research</span> and user testing about the prototype to make it even better
                    </p>
