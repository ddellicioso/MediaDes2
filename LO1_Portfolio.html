                    <p>
                        I made both low fidelity and high fidelity <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/Lrn9pBiNfpGMuepb7oTMVH/Portfolio?t=DOnTMIGWNkCljIt8-1" target="_blank">prototype</a>  for my portfolio so that I can test my ideas, gather some feedbacks and iterate my designs before start to implement them

                            <p>
                                After making a quick sketch about the layout and everything, I directly went to make a low fidelity prototype in Figma to make a <span class="highlight">quick iterations</span> and to see if I need to change or add anything.
                                 when I'm sure that it's good enough, I made the high fidelity. <br><br>
                                 When I was done I went to <span class="highlight">five teachers</span> to ask about their opinions about it and to do user testing on them. 
                                 So far when I showed them, they didn't have any problem with it (with any display, colors, or functionality) and majority of them had a very <span class="highlight">positive feedback</span>  about my idea.

                                I showed Anke my layout and this are her feedbacks:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pop up layout for the content might be too <span class="highlight">long and boring</span>.</li>
                                    <li>Consider an alternative to the pop up layout</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p> After the feedback I try to look for some <span class="highlight">inspirations</span>  in Pinterest and I start to sketch my idea.
                                I showed my idea directly to Anke and she said that it's really nice and she likes the idea of the <span class="highlight">slideshow</span>. <br>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">How did it went</span>: Creating both low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes for my portfolio was an enlightening experience that significantly contributed to the development process. Transitioning to a low fidelity prototype in Figma allowed me to make <span class="highlight">quick iterations and adjustments</span> . I created a high fidelity version to help me present a more <span class="highlight">polished and realistic</span>  representation of the final product. To gather feedback and conduct user testing, I approached five different teachers. Their overwhelmingly positive feedback reassured me that the design was on the <span class="highlight">right track</span> .<br><br>
                        <span class="how">What did I learn</span>: First I learned the value of <span class="highlight">iterative design</span> ; moving from low fidelity to high fidelity prototypes underscored the importance of <span class="highlight">refining and validating</span> ideas at each stage, sving time and effort in the long run. The importance of seeking feedback became clear as the teachers provided insights that I might overlooked.<br><br>
                        <span class="how">What will change</span>: Instead of just discussing new ideas, like the slideshow concept suggested by Anke, I would create additional low fidelity prototypes for <span class="highlight">all proposed changes</span>.
