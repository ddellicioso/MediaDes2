                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        I made the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cuYoqFUJBwe5WSyxGKiWfTO2WB9_LM4B8t_zZkniyOo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">survey</a> to receive some insights on how I should design my <span class="highlight">scary character</span>. I explicitly spread the survey among <span class="highlight">Indonesian people</span> to gain <span class="highlight">authentic answers</span> and <span class="highlight">vision</span>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="did">
                        <h3>What I Did</h3>
                    
                        <div class="did_content">
                            <p>
                                My first step was <span class="highlight">browsing</span> through the internet to look at some <span class="highlight">references</span> on how <span class="highlight">Pocong</span> (the scary character) is supposed to look. I watched some (supposedly) <span class="highlight">“found” footage</span> of Pocong to get an idea of their <span class="highlight">behavior</span> and where they are usually <span class="highlight">found</span>. After that, I started making the <span class="highlight">questions</span> to be put in the survey.
                                <br><br>
                                The questions included the <span class="highlight">design</span> of its appearance (<span class="highlight">eyes</span>, <span class="highlight">skin color</span>, <span class="highlight">shroud condition</span>, etc.), their <span class="highlight">body posture</span>, and the <span class="highlight">background</span> (their location). I shared the survey with all of my Indonesian friends.
                                <br><br>
                                The result of the survey was more or less the same as what I expected. Even though I got fewer responses than my goal, the <span class="highlight">answers</span> were still very <span class="highlight">helpful</span> for my design choices.
                            </p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">How it went</span>: The process of creating and distributing the survey to gain insights on designing the scary character, Pocong, went relatively well. Initially, I conducted thorough <span class="highlight">research</span> by browsing various references and watching supposed “found” footage to understand Pocong's typical <span class="highlight">appearance</span> and <span class="highlight">behavior</span>. This research phase was crucial in forming the basis of the survey questions, which focused on various aspects of the character's design such as <span class="highlight">eyes</span>, <span class="highlight">skin color</span>, <span class="highlight">shroud condition</span>, <span class="highlight">body posture</span>, and typical <span class="highlight">locations</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        After drafting the questions, I distributed the survey among my <span class="highlight">Indonesian friends</span> to ensure the feedback was <span class="highlight">authentic</span> and <span class="highlight">culturally relevant</span>. While the number of responses was lower than anticipated, the quality of the responses was high and provided valuable insights that aligned closely with my initial expectations.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What I learned</span>: The initial research phase was important in creating relevant and specific survey questions. Understanding the <span class="highlight">cultural context</span> and typical features of Pocong helped in formulating questions that would yield useful insights. Ensuring that the survey was spread among <span class="highlight">Indonesian people</span> was crucial for obtaining authentic and culturally relevant feedback. This reinforced the importance of understanding and respecting <span class="highlight">cultural contexts</span> in design projects.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What will change</span>: While maintaining a focus on cultural relevance, I will also consider expanding the demographic scope to include different <span class="highlight">age groups</span>, <span class="highlight">regions</span>, and <span class="highlight">backgrounds</span> within Indonesia to gain a more comprehensive understanding of perceptions about Pocong.
