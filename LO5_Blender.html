                    <p>
                        My efforts to learn Blender by watching tutorials in YouTube
                    </p>

                        <h3>What I Did</h3>
                        <h4 id="cake">Cake</h4>
                        <div class="did_content">
                            
                            <p>
                                This is the <span class="highlight">first time</span> I ever touched <span class="highlight">Blender</span> and I've always wanted to try to make some 3D things. I wanted to be a <span class="highlight">horror game designer</span> so that means I want to be in <span class="highlight">Game Design specialization</span> later in <span class="highlight">semester 4</span>.
                                <br><br>
                                The first time I used Blender, so of course I looked into some <span class="highlight">YouTube tutorials</span> and I found a popular tutorial from <span class="highlight">Blender Guru</span>. The tutorial showed how to make a <span class="highlight">donut</span> but I <span class="highlight">didn't want</span> to just <span class="highlight">blindly follow</span> him so I decided to make a tart <span class="highlight">cake</span> instead.
                                <br><br>
                                So far, I <span class="highlight">really liked sculpting</span> and I found myself enjoying it so much. Unfortunately, lately I <span class="highlight">didn't have any time</span> to continue my cake even though I really want to start learning about <span class="highlight">coloring</span>, <span class="highlight">texturing</span>, and more.
                                <br><br>
                                Update on my cake: <br><br>
                                I <span class="highlight">learned</span>  some more things after watching more tutorials about <span class="highlight">texture paint</span>, <span class="highlight">geometry nodes</span>, and <span class="highlight">weight paint</span>. Texture paint was <span class="highlight">easy to do</span>  and quite fun but I still <span class="highlight">don't understand</span>  the placement of the <span class="highlight">color on the "paper"</span>  so I need to dive deeper into this part.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="highlight">Geometry nodes</span> are <span class="highlight">hard</span> . I used geometry nodes to make the <span class="highlight">sprinkles</span> (density and colors). I <span class="highlight">don't understand</span>  how those become like that and how do I know which one I should tweak? Sadly, the YouTube <span class="highlight">tutorial</span>  I watched <span class="highlight">wasn't much of help</span>  and I ended up blindly following it without actually understanding what those meant.
                                <br><br>
                                To make the sprinkles' density more realistically placed, I learned and used <span class="highlight">weight paint</span>. The <span class="highlight">red</span>  areas are for more <span class="highlight">concentrated sprinkles</span>  while the <span class="highlight">blue</span>  ones mean <span class="highlight">fewer sprinkles</span> . It wasn't hard to follow up the tutorial and understand it.
                                <br><br>
                                After all of the tweaks, I finally finished the cake. It doesn't look that appetizing but I'm proud of the finished look; at least I tried my best to make it my own cake. I rendered it with <span class="highlight">GPU</span> and it lags so much, and I don't know if that's a normal thing or not.
                                <br><br>
                                Throughout the entire process, I'm glad my <span class="highlight">laptop never crashed</span> , not even once, and I didn't have to do all of the process all over again. Even though my laptop hasn't crashed, I hope I <span class="highlight">could've saved the file</span>  more <span class="highlight">often to prevent</span>  such a thing from happening.
                                <br><br>
                                Overall, I'm pretty <span class="highlight">satisfied</span>  with the result and the amount of <span class="highlight">new knowledge</span>  I got by making this cake and watching tutorials. Though, I still <span class="highlight">need to dive deeper</span>  and learn more about <span class="highlight">texture paint</span>  and <span class="highlight">especially geometry nodes</span> .

                            <p>I showed my finished cake to Blender teachers (Chris, Jan, and Josh) and asked them what they think about it. I mentioned to Jan and Josh that I watched Blender Guru tutorials and they <span class="highlight">recommended</span>  me a <span class="highlight">better channel</span>  called <span class="highlight">Ryan King Art</span> , and I for sure will watch more tutorials from it. Here's what they said about the cake:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Can put some <span class="highlight">texture</span>  on the cake</li>

                                    <li>Good job on <span class="highlight">not blindly following</span>  the tutors</li>
                                    <li>Nice job despite learning Blender for the first time</li>

                            <p>
                                Other than watching YouTube, I also <span class="highlight">joined Blender workshops</span> at school. Currently we are learning on how to make a <span class="highlight">kitchen diorama</span>, and it was fun and <span class="highlight">not too complex</span> and intimidating for me so I really enjoyed it.
                                <br><br>
                                I used <span class="highlight">"Shear"</span> tool to make the <span class="highlight">fridge's dispenser</span>  look more real; the shear tool makes the dispenser <span class="highlight">tilt</span> . Then I constructed a <span class="highlight">window</span>  near the fridge to gave it more accent in the diorama. I didn't know how to efficiently make a window, so I just did what I think is logical; in the end it works, but if we look at it from "edit mode" it looks <span class="highlight">messy</span> . 
                                <br><br>
                                Then I put some <span class="highlight">chairs and a table</span> , and gave it some <span class="highlight">colors</span>  on the fridge, stove, etc. To be honest, the rendered result looked like it was made by an AI (or that's what I feel like). Other than that, I'm quite happy with the result even though I didn't really learn anything new but I'm glad I can use my knowledge and do more practice.

                        <span class="highlight how">How it went</span>: My first individual practice into <span class="highlight">Blender</span> was both exciting and challenging. Inspired by the <span class="highlight">Blender Guru</span> donut tutorial, I decided to create a <span class="highlight">tart cake</span> as my first project. <span class="highlight">Sculpting</span> turned out to be enjoyable, and I was eager to learn more about <span class="highlight">coloring</span> and <span class="highlight">texturing</span>, but <span class="highlight">time constraints</span> made it difficult to progress as quickly as I wanted. Despite these challenges, I managed to learn about <span class="highlight">texture paint</span>, <span class="highlight">geometry nodes</span>, and <span class="highlight">weight paint</span> through additional YouTube tutorials. <span class="highlight">Texture painting</span> was relatively straightforward, but <span class="highlight">geometry nodes</span> proved to be quite complex. Nevertheless, I applied <span class="highlight">weight paint</span> successfully to create realistic sprinkles on my cake.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to my YouTube-based learning, I participated in Blender workshops at school, where I worked on a <span class="highlight">kitchen diorama</span>. This project was <span class="highlight">less complex</span>  and allowed me to practice my skills with tools like the <span class="highlight">shear tool</span> for more realistic modeling. While I didn't learn many new concepts during this project, it was a good opportunity to apply my existing knowledge. My teachers provided valuable feedback on my cake, suggesting improvements and recommending better tutorial channels, which was both encouraging and motivating.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="highlight how">What I learned</span>: Throughout this journey, I discovered a <span class="highlight">passion for sculpting</span> , finding it both therapeutic and enjoyable. I learned the basics of <span class="highlight">texture painting</span> but realized the need for a <span class="highlight">deeper understanding</span>  of <span class="highlight">color placement</span>. <span class="highlight">Geometry nodes</span> were particularly challenging, indicating a need for <span class="highlight">further study</span> .
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="highlight how">What will change</span>: I will dedicate more time to understanding <span class="highlight">geometry nodes</span> through better tutorial channels, I will implement a habit of saving my work more frequently to prevent data loss. Lastly, I will continue working on <span class="highlight">practical projects</span>  to apply my skills in different contexts and improve my modeling techniques.
