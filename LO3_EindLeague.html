                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p> Eindhoven League is organized by PPI Eindhoven and refers to a <span class="highlight">sports tournament</span> hosted by the Indonesian Student Association in Eindhoven. <br><br>
                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ppieindhoven/?hl=en" target="_blank">PPI Eindhoven</a> stands for "Perhimpunan Pelajar Indonesia Eindhoven", which translates to <span class="highlight">"Indonesian Student Association in Eindhoven"</span>. This organization is part of a network of Indonesian student associations in various cities around the world. PPI Eindhoven serves as a community and support system for Indonesian students studying at institutions in Eindhoven.

                            <p>
                                I joined <span class="highlight">Eindhoven League</span> (a yearly sport competition held by Indonesian Students in Eindhoven) as a personal project. Here I was assigned to be the <span class="highlight">Social Media</span> person and I was tasked to make the posts (feed and Instagram story) to be uploaded in PPI Eindhoven Instagram account. I used <span class="highlight">Adobe Illustrator</span> to make an illustration-only post and <span class="highlight">Canva</span> to put contents inside the posts.

                            <p>
                                The first task I received was to make a <span class="highlight">color palette</span> and <span class="highlight">logo</span>. I looked into Pinterest for references and inspirations for both. This year's theme is "Gear Up: Innovate and Win" and I felt like <span class="highlight">sci-fi</span> or <span class="highlight">cyberpunk colors</span> would fit with the theme, so I combined these inspirations and asked our team (Social Media team) to vote which one fits more with the theme.
                            </p>    

                            <aside>

                                Most of the people voted for the second palette, so we used that as our <span class="highlight">color scheme</span>. <br>
                                Next was to make the <span class="highlight">logo</span> for this year's competition. The theme for this year is <span class="highlight">"Gear Up"</span> so I thought that <span class="highlight">something with gears</span> would fit the theme. I sketched several logo ideas and asked my peers for feedback.

                                After further discussion, we decided to use the <span class="highlight">3rd logo</span> (3 gears) because it represents both <span class="highlight">sports and gears</span> (the theme). After deciding on the logo, I moved to <span class="highlight">Illustrator</span> to illustrate it. To be honest, this was my <span class="highlight">first time</span> using Adobe Illustrator, so I <span class="highlight">struggled</span> quite a lot to figure out how to implement it. <br>
                                *See details on how I made the logo in LO5*.

                            <p>
                                After successfully making the color palette and the logo, I moved on to making the <span class="highlight">poster</span> to be posted on the Instagram account. I needed to make a <span class="highlight">carousel</span> "coming soon" <span class="highlight">post</span> on Instagram. <br><br>
                                I used the color palette and added a touch of <span class="highlight">futuristic theme</span>. For example, I made a hologram projector to "project" the words, and used <span class="highlight">glow effects</span> on most elements to enhance the <span class="highlight">futuristic</span> feel. I had the hardest time making the gears since this was my first time using Adobe Illustrator. <br>
                                But in the end, I succeeded in making the post and it was directly posted on Instagram. *Check the post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ppieindhoven/?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>!*

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">How it went</span>: Initially, I joined Eindhoven League as a <span class="highlight">personal project</span>, focusing on social media posts for PPI Eindhoven. My tasks included <span class="highlight">creating</span> a <span class="highlight">color palette</span> and <span class="highlight">logo</span>, and designing a <span class="highlight">poster</span> for Instagram. The process involved multiple iterations and feedback sessions, which significantly improved the final output. Working with Illustrator for the <span class="highlight">first time</span> was <span class="highlight">challenging</span>, but ultimately rewarding. 
                        <br> 
                        <span class="highlight">Dividing my time</span> for this personal project and <span class="highlight">school's projects</span> are quite <span class="highlight">hard</span> for me since I needed to do lots of things and sometimes I <span class="highlight">needed to sacrifice</span> my time for this projects making me not putting much attention and details into it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">What I learned</span>: Through this project, I learned the importance of clear, structured content and effective design principles. I also <span class="highlight">gained</span> valuable <span class="highlight">experience</span> using <span class="highlight">Adobe Illustrator</span>, enhancing my technical skills and ability to translate conceptual ideas <span class="highlight">into visual designs</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">What will change</span>: In future projects, I want to <span class="highlight">learn more </span>about things I could do to <span class="highlight">improvise</span> and enhance the products that I made and posted. I also want to make sure that my produts are <span class="highlight">professional</span> enough to be showcased to people.
                    </p>
