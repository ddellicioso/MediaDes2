                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        This user test is conducted to test our final prototype of our project before stepping into implementation and as well as observing any potential issues. The test serves as a small framework into figuring out what needed to stay/change. 
                    </p>

                    <div class="did">
                        <h3>What I Did</h3>

                        <div class="feedback">
                            <p>
                                I used <span class="highlight">CMD Methods</span> to conduct the <span class="highlight">user test</span>, which is <span class="highlight">Usability Testing</span>. Before I conduct the test, I made sure to <span class="highlight">define my objectives</span> to set clear goals on what I wanted to learn from the usability testing, such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">Is the new content appealing to the intended audience?</span></li>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">Does the content structure and layout align with the target audience's requirements?</span></li>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">Can users easily find the easter egg?</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since my group’s <span class="highlight">target audience</span> is <span class="highlight">Dutch teenagers and their parents</span>, we weren’t able to find such participants so we decided to recruit some Dutch students around <span class="highlight">Fontys</span>. When I conducted the tests, I had users manually <span class="highlight">interact with the product</span> while I’m observing their actions and noted any issues.
                                <br><br>
                                After users are done, I collected detailed <span class="highlight">feedback</span> about their experience, any difficulties they encountered, and their overall satisfaction. I then reviewed the feedback and observations to identify <span class="highlight">patterns</span>, <span class="highlight">common issues</span>, and <span class="highlight">areas for improvement</span>; then compiled the results into a <span class="highlight">report</span>, highlighting key findings for enhancing the <span class="highlight">usability</span> of the website.

                                After conducting user tests, we received numerous feedbacks such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"Apply Now" button <span class="highlight">didn't work</span> </li>

                                    <li>Adding <span class="highlight">underlines</span>  on "Contact Us" links when hovered to enhance visibility</li>
                                </ul>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">How it went</span>: The <span class="highlight">user test</span> provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of our final <span class="highlight">prototype</span> and highlighted <span class="highlight">areas for improvement</span> before implementation. Overall, the test went smoothly, allowing us to observe <span class="highlight">user interactions</span> and gather detailed <span class="highlight">feedback</span> on <span class="highlight">functionality</span>, <span class="highlight">user experience</span>, and <span class="highlight">design effectiveness</span>. 
                        <br><br>
                        Through the use of <span class="highlight">CMD Methods</span>, specifically <span class="highlight">Usability Testing</span>, we were able to gather comprehensive feedback from users. This included insights into whether the new content resonated with the intended audience, whether the structure and layout met their needs, and whether users could easily find the easter egg.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What I learned</span>: From the feedback received, I learned of several issues that need attention. The non-functioning <span class="highlight">"Apply Now" button</span> and inconsistencies in the <span class="highlight">header icons</span> are critical issues that require immediate resolution. On a positive note, users were able to find and interact with the <span class="highlight">hidden surprise</span>, indicating its successful implementation.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What will change</span>: Moving forward, I will prioritize addressing the identified issues to ensure a <span class="highlight">seamless user experience</span>. This may involve troubleshooting <span class="highlight">technical issues</span>, refining <span class="highlight">design elements</span> for consistency, and implementing suggested enhancements such as underlining <span class="highlight">"Contact us" links</span> for improved visibility.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, the user test was instrumental in identifying areas for refinement and validating the effectiveness of our prototype. By addressing the feedback received, I aim to enhance the <span class="highlight">usability</span> and <span class="highlight">functionality</span> of our project, ultimately delivering a more satisfying experience for our users.
