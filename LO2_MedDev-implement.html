                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the third and last group project, we were asked to fix fontys ICT’s website and implement them. My teammates and I made <a href="LO3_P3MedDev.html" target="_blank">some iterations</a>  of <a href="LO1_MedDev.html" target="_blank">Figma prototype</a>  of our ideas on <a href="https://i522224.hera.fontysict.net/FontysWebDev/index.html" target="_blank">our version of fontys website</a>  before actually implementing them.
                    </p>

                    <div class="did">
                        <h3>What I Did</h3>
                    
                        <div class="did_content">
                            <p>
                                I was tasked to make the <span class="highlight">profile page</span> (media page), so after receiving <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAmOS1DuFbbAK4KB69Uhnzn66WNYS_fCV3_DnjuRd7o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">answers from the survey</a> and did some iterations regarding the page, I started making the <span class="highlight">HTML</span> and <span class="highlight">CSS</span>. Fortunately, my teammates already made the <span class="highlight">navigation</span> and <span class="highlight">footer</span> section, so I just needed to focus on making the profile page.
                                <br><br>
                                The responses from the survey really helped a lot because I didn’t need to think about how I should <span class="highlight">organize the content</span> since the respondents already told me what to do as well as which <span class="highlight">design</span> I should make. 
                                <br><br>
                                The hardest part to make was creating the <span class="highlight">carousel image</span> for the <span class="highlight">job opportunity</span> section. I did make something similar for my <span class="highlight">portfolio</span> (previously) but the mechanic is a little bit different. Instead of showing the images one by one, I needed to show 3 images at once and when the next/previous button is clicked, the carousel moves only the most left/right image. After the struggle, I finally succeeded in making it functional even though it’s a little bit different from the prototype but I did my best.

                                On the day of the last presentation, we showed our finished product to our classmates and the client.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">How it went</span>: I was responsible for the <span class="highlight">profile page</span> (media design). Using the <span class="highlight">survey responses</span> as a guide, I started building the <span class="highlight">HTML</span> and <span class="highlight">CSS</span> for the page. The survey feedback was incredibly helpful because it gave me a clear direction on how to <span class="highlight">organize the content</span> and which <span class="highlight">design elements</span> to include. <br><br>
                        The toughest part was creating the <span class="highlight">image carousel</span> for the <span class="highlight">job opportunities</span> section. Unlike my previous <span class="highlight">portfolio carousel</span> that showed images one by one, this one needed to display three images at once and move only one image left or right with each click. After struggling and searching through tutorials, I finally got it to work. While it ended up a bit different from the <span class="highlight">prototype</span>, I did my best to make it functional. <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What I learned</span>: The survey responses were valuable. They saved me a lot of guesswork and ensured the design met user expectations. Creating a more complex carousel taught me a lot about advanced <span class="highlight">CSS</span> and <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span> techniques. It was challenging but rewarding to see it work. <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What will change</span>: Based on the feedback, I’ll make sure that elements that look clickable actually are clickable to avoid confusion. For projects and external links, I’ll make sure they <span class="highlight">open in new tabs</span> to improve user experience. Overall, this project was a great learning experience. It showed me the importance of user feedback, the complexities of advanced web features, and the value of <span class="highlight">teamwork</span>.
