                                I’ve always wanted to be a <span class="highlight">game designer</span>, especially <span class="highlight">horror game</span>. I love watching people playing horror games and I dreamed to make a psychological VR horror game (because I think that’s even scarier). I was really happy that I get to learn about Blender in this semester because it means I’m a step closer to being a game designer, which also leads to my <span class="highlight">Sprint X</span> project decision.
                                <br><br>
                                For <span class="highlight">Sprint X</span> *here’s the link for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UtT4Ez8-L5iKWaIi4k4zFx_vPfo73j0UCwlgR6QS2lY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">planning</a>*, I decided to make use of it as a practice for my Blender skill; I’ll be making a 3D horror character from one of the most famous ghosts from Indonesia, <span class="highlight">Pocong</span>. At first, I thought of making <span class="highlight">Leak</span> (a mythical creature from Bali, Indonesia) but after talking to Chris, it’ll be too hard for me to make it with my skill right now. My goal for this project is that my skill in Blender will increase and will broaden my knowledge about designing 3D characters.
                                <br><br>
                                In <span class="highlight">semester 4</span>, I’m planning to go to <span class="highlight">Game Design specialization</span> and for the <span class="highlight">Minor</span> program, I’m planning to go either <span class="highlight">VR minor</span> or something about psychology. For an <span class="highlight">internship</span>, I joined Career Day in TQ and I found one company called <span class="highlight">LiveWall</span> that is really interesting and kind of fits my goal. I talked to them about the possibility of internships, how they work in the company, what language they are using to make games (it’s unity), etc. Even though they are not specifically about ‘horror’ games, but I’m pretty sure if I get there, I will get more experiences about games.

                    <p>
                        Most of my skills right now are more into <span class="highlight">web developer</span> (<span class="highlight">HTML</span>, <span class="highlight">CSS</span>); while my goal is to be a <span class="highlight">game designer</span>. Fortunately, this semester taught me about <span class="highlight">Blender</span> which will help me achieve my dream. I am doing everything I can to learn more about Blender and designing, which is why my <span class="highlight">Sprint X</span> project is to make a scary character.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the hardest personal challenges I’ve encountered was <span class="highlight">time management</span>. At the start of the semester, I decided to join an organization called <span class="highlight">Eindhoven League</span> *see in <a href="LO3_EindLeague.html" target="_blank">LO3</a> and <a href="LO5_EindLeague.html" target="_blank">LO5</a>*, and that took a lot of my time that I could’ve used to do my school work. For quite some time, I couldn’t catch up with the amount of school work I needed to do and this moment really stressed me out.
                        <br><br>
                        After having a talk with my friend (she has nice time management), she gave me some tips such as, breaking tasks into smaller steps, making a to-do list, and eliminate distractions. After implementing the tips my friend gave me, I started getting the hang of my projects. I started to learn to be more productive and use my time wisely, which made me able to finish my tasks properly and on schedule.
