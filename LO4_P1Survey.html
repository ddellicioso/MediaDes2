                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        This <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vYHjLSNLY6X7xbiKJWUjEGip0aiepcFSWzcmu9Jep1A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">survey</a> is conducted to dig deeper into what makes people join <span class="highlight">orchestra</span> and what keeps them there. I covered stuff like how they found out about orchestras, when they started playing, why they love it, and where they get their info. Plus, I wanted to know how <span class="highlight">social media</span> and parents play into it all.
                    </p>

                    <div class="did">
                        <h3>What I Did</h3>

                        <div class="did_content">
                            <p>
                                I put together this <span class="highlight">survey</span> with questions covering everything from how people first <span class="highlight">heard about orchestras</span> to why they decided to join. To keep things simple, I offered <span class="highlight">multiple-choice options</span> and showed percentages to make it <span class="highlight">easy to understand</span> . The survey covered a wide range of topics, including when people <span class="highlight">started playing</span>, what they <span class="highlight">love most</span>  about being in an <span class="highlight">orchestra</span>, and where they get their <span class="highlight">info about music events</span>. I aimed to make the survey fun and easy to fill out to encourage more participation.
                                <br><br>
                                Overall, I got some really cool insights from the survey. It was interesting to see how <span class="highlight">many people</span>  find out about orchestras through <span class="highlight">social media</span> these days, and how much their <span class="highlight">parents influence</span> their musical journey. Now that I have all this data, I can start figuring out ways to make orchestra life even better for everyone involved. Maybe I'll focus more on social media outreach or find ways to make orchestras more family-friendly.
                                <br><br>
                                Since the majority of people found out about the orchestra through social media, I relayed the data to my teammates; and from these <span class="highlight">data</span> I acquired, my team was able to make couple of products, such as <span class="highlight">social media planning</span>, <span class="highlight">posters</span>, and a better <span class="highlight">website</span> *You can see the prototype in <a href="LO1_PBranding.html" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">LO 1 here</span></a> *.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="how">How it went</span>: The <span class="highlight">survey</span> went really well overall. I received good response rate and gathered a lot of <span class="highlight">valuable insights</span>  into <span class="highlight">orchestra membership</span>. The survey gave a deep understanding of <span class="highlight">how people find out</span>  about orchestras, when they start <span class="highlight">getting into</span>  music, what they <span class="highlight">love</span>  most about being part of an orchestra, and what keeps them coming back for more. <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What I learned</span>: I learned about how significant <span class="highlight">social media</span> has become in people’s discovery of orchestras. It’s clear that platforms like <span class="highlight">Facebook</span> and <span class="highlight">Instagram</span> play a big role in reaching potential members. Additionally, it was eye-opening to see the strong influence <span class="highlight">parents</span> have on their children's musical journeys. <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What will change</span>: I'll likely put more focus on <span class="highlight">social media outreach</span>, maybe even investing in <span class="highlight">targeted ads</span> or partnering with <span class="highlight">influencers</span>. Additionally, I want to explore ways to better involve <span class="highlight">parents</span> in the orchestra community, perhaps by <span class="highlight">offering special events</span>  or resources tailored to them.
