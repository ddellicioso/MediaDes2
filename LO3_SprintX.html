                    <p>
                        For my personal project, I decided to make a <span class="highlight">3D scary character</span> as a practice for my <span class="highlight">Blender skill</span> *more details are <a href="LO5_CoreValues.html" target="_blank">here</a> *. Before starting making the <span class="highlight">3D character</span>, I made a <span class="highlight">survey</span> directed to Indonesia people to receive more <span class="highlight">authentic feedbacks</span> *more details in <a href="LO4_SprintXSurvey.html">LO4</a> *. Below are my journey making my first <span class="highlight">3D character project</span>.
                    </p>

                    <div class="did">
                        <h3>What I Did</h3>

                        <div class="did_content">
                            <p>
                                After I made the <span class="highlight">survey</span> *here*, I looked into the responses I received and started roughly <span class="highlight">sketching the character</span> based on the answers. background based on the result of the research and the survey.
                                <!-- <br><br> I also conducted simple <span class="highlight">research</span> *here* on the internet to know the <span class="highlight">characteristics</span> of my character, such as, where is the <span class="highlight">ghost</span> usually found, what would make the <span class="highlight">appearance scarier</span>, etc. After that, I made a <span class="highlight">sketch</span> for the -->
                                After the <span class="highlight">sketch</span> of the character (body) was done, I moved to <span class="highlight">Illustrator</span> to make the illustration clearer. It didn’t take long because I only made the lines cleaner and more visible so I can make the <span class="highlight">character in 3D</span> easier.

                            <p>
                                I asked for <span class="highlight">feedback</span> regarding the final <span class="highlight">sketch</span> (both the character’s body and the background) to Chris:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The character's shape is straightforward so it's <span class="highlight">easy to make</span> </li>
                                    <li>The background makes everything complete</li>
                                    <li>Start blocking the scene with <span class="highlight">simple shapes</span> and <span class="highlight">PNG images</span>  to see if the composition works</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After the <span class="highlight">feedback</span>, first of all, I made the <span class="highlight">character in Blender</span> with some help from YouTube. It was pretty easy to make since all I need to do is extrude and scale several times. Then I <span class="highlight">sculpted the face</span>; I made hollow eye sockets, a nose, and sunken cheeks. I love <span class="highlight">sculpting</span> so I really enjoyed making the face.
                                <br><br>
                                After making the face and the body, I searched for some <span class="highlight">PNG trees</span> and put them in Blender to see the composition like Chris said.

                        <div class="feedback">
                            <p>
                                After the layout and the character are combined, I seek another <span class="highlight">feedback</span>. So, I came to Jan (my semester coach) to show him the progress. I showed him my <span class="highlight">sketches</span>, the <span class="highlight">survey</span>, and the <span class="highlight">layout in Blender</span>.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Suggested using <span class="highlight">sculpt</span> to make the character’s cloth more realistic</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        
                        </div>

                        <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
                        <div class="did_content">
                            <p>
                                I did what I was told to do, make the cloth more <span class="highlight">realistic</span>. Other than that, I started making the <span class="highlight">trees</span> (regular trees and banana trees) with, of course, some tutorials. The hardest one to make was the <span class="highlight">banana trees</span>; I needed to make a bunch of bananas, then the leaves, and finally combine all of them. The regular trees aren’t that hard to make.
                                <br><br>
                                Then I started putting <span class="highlight">textures</span> (on the alley walls) and colors. On the alley walls, I put some <span class="highlight">moss</span> to make it more realistic. It took quite a long time to make the moss and I was frustrated because the first time it didn’t work really well so I ended up taking a whole day to make that. But in the end, I managed to make it work.
                                <br><br>
                                Then I started putting <span class="highlight">lights</span> to set the mood, such as: street lamps and atmospheric rays. After I put all those in, I’m quite happy with the result and it looks exactly like I want it to be.

                    <p>
                        <span class="how">How it went</span>: The process of creating a <span class="highlight">3D scary character in Blender</span> was both challenging and rewarding. From conducting <span class="highlight">surveys</span> and <span class="highlight">research</span> to <span class="highlight">sketching</span> and <span class="highlight">sculpting</span>, each step provided valuable insights and practical experience.

                        The process of creating a <span class="highlight">3D scary character in Blender</span> was both challenging and rewarding. From conducting <span class="highlight">surveys</span> and <span class="highlight">research</span> to <span class="highlight">sketching</span> and <span class="highlight">sculpting</span>, each step provided valuable insights and practical experience.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What I learned</span>: Through this project, I learned several important lessons. Firstly, I realized the importance of <span class="highlight">planning</span> and <span class="highlight">research</span> before diving into the actual modeling. The <span class="highlight">survey results</span> and my <span class="highlight">research</span> on the characteristics of <span class="highlight">scary ghosts</span> were crucial in shaping the final <span class="highlight">character design</span>. I also discovered that <span class="highlight">sketching</span> and refining those <span class="highlight">sketches</span> in <span class="highlight">Illustrator</span> made the <span class="highlight">3D modeling</span> process much smoother.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the most significant technical skills I honed was <span class="highlight">sculpting in Blender</span>. I particularly enjoyed <span class="highlight">sculpting the face</span>, learning how to create hollow eye sockets, a nose, and sunken cheeks to give the character a spooky look. The <span class="highlight">feedback</span> to make the character’s clothing more realistic taught me the value of fine details in enhancing the overall appearance of the model.
                        <br><br>
                        The process of adding <span class="highlight">textures</span> and <span class="highlight">lighting</span> was a big learning curve. Creating realistic textures, especially the moss on the alley walls, was challenging but ultimately rewarding. This experience underscored the importance of <span class="highlight">perseverance</span> and <span class="highlight">attention to detail</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="how">What will change</span>: Moving forward, I aim to improve my <span class="highlight">texturing</span> and <span class="highlight">lighting techniques</span> further. While I was happy with the final result, I know there’s always room for improvement. I will explore more advanced <span class="highlight">tutorials</span> and practice different methods to enhance the <span class="highlight">realism</span> of my models.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, I will embrace challenges with a positive mindset, knowing that persistence and problem-solving are key to success in <span class="highlight">3D modeling</span>. This project has boosted my <span class="highlight">confidence</span> and reinforced my passion for <span class="highlight">3D design</span>, motivating me to continue pursuing my <span class="highlight">dream job</span> in this field.
